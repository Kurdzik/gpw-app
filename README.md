## GPW Stock Exchange Analytics app
<hr>
Main purpose of this project is to:
<hr>
<li> provide easy access to stock prices (although those can be checked on sites like bankier.pl or stooq.com or gpw.pl, from here those can be downloaded easily)
<li> suggest the direction in which stock price will move (but please don't make any financial decision based on this prediction alone)
<li> create a connection with local DB to receive daily updates of stock prices (upload usulally takes place around 23)
